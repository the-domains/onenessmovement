            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Observable Universe (accurately scaled zoom out from Earth)</h1><p>“This video illustrates the scaled size of our universe from quarks to the entirety of the observable universe. Each circle used in the video represents a scale factor of 10; meaning each larger circle is zoomed out 10x more than its predecessor. ( i.e. after 1 circle you are now looking at 10x larger horizon, after 2 circles 100x, 3 would be 1000x, and so forth. This also applies to the speed, ignoring relativistic effects, at which the observer (you) would be traveling.) </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04d99b30e8e9caa7da66a37e73ccb0e42352782f.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Pale Blue Dot - THE SAGAN SERIES</h1><p>“From this distant vantage point, the earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/329709c981f9f237dc67d13e6e116f1f52ee8206.jpg"></article>]]></description>
