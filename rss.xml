            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What is the most astounding fact you can share with us about the Universe?</h1><p>“The most astounding fact is the knowledge that the atoms that comprise life on Earth, the atoms that make up the human body, are traceable to the crucibles that cooked light elements into heavy elements in their core under extreme temperatures and pressures. These stars, the high mass ones among them went unstable in their later years. They collapsed and then exploded scattering their enriched guts across the galaxy - guts made of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and all the fundamental ingredients of life itself. These ingredients become part of gas cloud that condense, collapse, form the next generation of solar systems: stars with orbiting planets. And, those planets now have the ingredients for life itself.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6a88a11eb62da0e7899ca4aafa6228592903f1ca.jpg"></article>]]></description>

But for us, it's different. Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/329709c981f9f237dc67d13e6e116f1f52ee8206.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Observable Universe (accurately scaled zoom out from Earth)</h1><p>“This video illustrates the scaled size of our universe from quarks to the entirety of the observable universe. Each circle used in the video represents a scale factor of 10; meaning each larger circle is zoomed out 10x more than its predecessor. ( i.e. after 1 circle you are now looking at 10x larger horizon, after 2 circles 100x, 3 would be 1000x, and so forth. This also applies to the speed, ignoring relativistic effects, at which the observer (you) would be traveling.) </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/04d99b30e8e9caa7da66a37e73ccb0e42352782f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
