"One question can change the course of history.

## Who are we?

**13.7 billion years ago** we were crammed into a single point.

**10 billion years ago** we were stars exploding into existence.

**3 billion years ago** we were bacteria, we were alive.

**550 million years ago** we were flatworms, we had hearts and brains.

**400 million years ago** we were fish, we had jaws.

**50 million years ago** we were great apes, we had arms, legs, and bigger brains.

**5 million years ago** we were humans, we had voice boxes.

**100 thousand years ago** we could talk, but could not ask this question: Who are we?

**1,000 years ago** we were all God's creations except the guys next door were heathens.

**200 years ago** we were British, French, American, Indian, Chinese.

**100 years ago** we had proof we were one species descendant from apes, few of us were pleased.

**60 years ago** we declare we're all human, entitled to the same human rights.

**10 years ago** we started saying, "We're global citizens!"

**Today**, we could tell a bigger story.

We could be human. We could create a cultural identity that moves us, that takes us places. Tell a story that sticks! And, 50 years from now we could be martians! 1 billion years from now we could be Andromedans living off new stars. 10 billion years from now we could be the creative force of our universe.

Or not...

We want to go places we have never been. Are you in?"
