# "What is a God?

What is it to think of something sacred and larger than us and infinite and boundless? Human history seems to be suffused with this inclination towards a sense of the divine.

We wanna believe that there's something more.

We've wanted to connect with this Higher Power, with this belief that there's something greater than ourselves, something that exceeds our capacities to understand.

And, we see Gods everywhere, myths and metaphors, old Gods, new Gods, vengeful Gods.

They rise and fall with the ebb and flow of all civilization. For ages, humankind, we've wanted to celebrate what brings us life, what is this thing that allowed us to emerge?

The Sun, the star, that right there is the source of all of our myths and allegories and hopes and dreams.

It gave life to the world, it gave birth to life. It's core burns at ten MILLION degrees and it consumes millions of tons of matter per SECOND.

We ourselves are made of remnants of its fallen siblings. The preconditions for our humanness, _that _certainly is what God is, right?

Let there be light!

It is larger than a million earths, can blind you from millions of miles away, it has reigned for billions of years and will thrive for billions more.

I think that's kinda fascinating."
